For example, the directory to be deleted is non-empty, an rmdir operation is applied to a non-directory, etc. Service implementors can use the following guidelines to decide between FAILED_PRECONDITION, ABORTED, and UNAVAILABLE: (a) Use UNAVAILABLE if the client can retry just the failing call. (b) Use ABORTED if the client should retry at a higher level (e.g., when a client-specified test-and-set fails, indicating the client should restart a read-modify-write sequence). (c) Use FAILED_PRECONDITION if the client should not retry until the system state has been explicitly fixed. E.g., if an "rmdir" fails because the directory is non-empty, FAILED_PRECONDITION should be returned since the client should not retry unless the files are deleted from the directory. */

Unlike INVALID_ARGUMENT, this error indicates a problem that may be fixed if the system state changes. For example, a 32-bit file system will generate INVALID_ARGUMENT if asked to read at an offset that is not in the range [0,2^32-1], but it will generate OUT_OF_RANGE if asked to read from an offset past the current file size. There is a fair bit of overlap between FAILED_PRECONDITION and OUT_OF_RANGE.
